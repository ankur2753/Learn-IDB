# Learn -IndexDB


## IndexDB is a database built into the browser itself

That's right, you heard correct a database built into the browser itself ,so you can store data locally be it for any
reason.

> IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. While Web Storage is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution.

It is a feature under web Worker API that mean it runs on a separate thread from the main script in the
background.Making it faster to run but at the same time more hectic to learn for beginners.At least I found it hectic
while I was tyring to learn , So this project is aimed at making learning of IDB(indexDB) a bit easier
